# IBM-NTU_Qiskit_Hackathon_2022
\n The raw files in the IBM-NTU Qiskit Hackathon 2022 competition
\n Due to tight deadline in the competition,  we did not optimize the codes to be readable. All functions are collected in the following files:

QAOA_for_Ising_2.ipynb is used to construct Ising model coefficient matrix (based on the problem-to-solve) and the corresponding quantum circuit.
QAOA_for_TSP(3_city).ipynb and QAOA_for_TSP(3_city).ipynb should merge into the file QAOA_for_Ising_2.ipynb for parameter optimization of thr quantum circuit.

Note that the optimizer does matter in finding the optimal solution.
The PPT slides are our presentation including the problem definition, QAOA, and the experiment results.
